# MDDOAI
This project transforms software architecture models into usable GitLab CI pipeline YAML code.

## Building
### 1. Clone the repo
Run this command:

```
git clone https://gitlab.com/model-driven-devops-ai/core.git
```

to clone the repo.

### 2. Build the tool
To build the tool first change directory to the `main` directory

```
cd ./main
```

Then run this **Gradle** command:

```
gradlew installDist
```

## Running
To use it run this command from the main directory:

```
./cli.bat <Type> <InputModelPath> <OutputFolder>
```

`<Type>` - this is the type of transformation. Currently only one is possible swarch2gitlab. This will take in the SW Arch model and generate a .gitlab-ci.yml file.

`<InputModelPath>` - This is the path to the input model.

`<OutputFolder>` - This is the output folder where the generated code will output to.

For example the command can look something like this:

```
./cli.bat swarch2gitlab ./src/test/resources/testCases/e2e/input1.swarch ./test/generatedCode
```

## Testing
To run the E2E, integration and unit tests you can run these commands individually:

```
./gradlew e2eTest
./gradlew integrationTest
./gradlew test
```

## Dependency Management
All project dependencies are managed through the build.gradle file using Gradle’s dependency management infrastructure.

### Core Libraries

- Commons IO – File handling utilities (copying, filtering, I/O abstraction)

- Commons CLI – Command-line argument parsing

### Eclipse Platform & Modeling

- Eclipse Core Runtime – OSGi-based plugin framework for model loading and service resolution

 - EMF (Eclipse Modeling Framework) – Model definition, XMI serialization, code generation

- OCL (Object Constraint Language) – Constraint handling for model validation

- Acceleo – Template-based model-to-text code generation (supports OCL)

### Transformation Engines

- ATL / Acceleo (via local JARs in libs/) – Model-to-model and model-to-text transformations

- Epsilon – Advanced model management: merging, migration, and transformation (EML, EMF, plain XML)

### Parsing Runtime

- LPG Runtime – Lightweight parser generator runtime used by ATL and OCL parsers

### Testing

- JUnit 4 & 5 – Unit, integration, and end-to-end test framework

- JUnit Platform – Underlying test engine for running mixed JUnit versions

- JUnit Vintage – Enables running legacy JUnit 4 tests on the JUnit 5 platform

To add or update dependencies, modify the dependencies block in the Gradle build script located in `main/build.gradle`.

## Project Structure
The project folder structure consists of these folders:

- `code_generation` - this folder contains the necessary Acceleo files to generate code from models.

- `designs` - this folder contains all Eclipse Sirius viewpoint projects that are used to visualize models and edit them.

- `feature` - this folder contains all  the necessary packages in one feature project

- `install_necessary_packages` - contains all the .zip files that need to be installed via the install new software view before using the tools in the project.

- `main` - this folder contains the MDDOAI itself. Under this folder there also is:

	- `transformations` - a folder responsible to translate from one model to another.

- `meta_models` - this folder contains meta-models used by this project that are modeled using the EMF (Eclipse Modelling Framework).

- `pipeline_tests` - this contains bash scripts that the pipeline runs to do some testing, for example to test wheter a file exists or not.

- `update_site` - this folder contains the reference to the feature from the feature folder and it is responsible for building the update site.
